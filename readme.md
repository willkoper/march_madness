March Madness
==============

I don't really care about basketball so the only games I wanna know about are the "Cindarella Stories" -- those games where the underdog actually has a chance of winning.

What does that mean?

Well, all I really care about is the last 5 minutes, and if the team is down by less than 10 points at any time in those 5 minutes, then it's anyone's ball game.

So far I've got a script to parse the json and figure out who the under dogs are in each matchup. The next step is to write a script that checks scores and times, and sees if any of these teams actually have a chance...
